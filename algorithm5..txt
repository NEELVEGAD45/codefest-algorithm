ALGORITHM:-


This code is a solution to a programming problem that involves calculating the maximum income generated from 
selling fruits harvested from different trees on different days. The problem statement is not included in the code, 
but here is a high-level algorithm for the solution:

Read the number of test cases from standard input.
For each test case, read the number of trees and the number of days from standard input.
For each day in the range of 1 to the number of days, do the following:
a. Calculate the number of days since the last harvest for each type of fruit tree.
b. Calculate the quantity of each fruit harvested on this day based on the number of days since the last harvest and the total number of trees.
c. Calculate the income generated by selling the harvested fruits based on their quantities and prices.
d. Keep track of the maximum income so far.
Print the maximum income for the current test case to standard output.
Repeat steps 2-4 for all test cases.
Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
