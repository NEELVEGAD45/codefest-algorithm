Algorithm:

Read the value of T, the number of test cases.

For each test case, do the following:

a. Read the values of B, C, and D.

b. Read the values of E, the number of customers at each time interval.

c. Initialize the variables bench_count, stool_count, and total_rent to 0.

d. For each time interval, do the following:

i. If the number of customers is greater than or equal to 2, rent/purchase a bench.

- Add the cost of the bench to the total_rent.
  - Increase bench_count by 1.

  - If the number of customers is odd, rent/purchase a stool.

    * Add the cost of the stool to the total_rent.
    * Increase stool_count by 1.
ii. If the number of customers is odd and less than 2, rent/purchase a stool.

- Add the cost of the stool to the total_rent.
  - Increase stool_count by 1.

e. Output the values of bench_count and total_rent for the test case.
